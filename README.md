I am adding a very good readme soon. This Demo will cover SRM with micrometer, APM, Error Tracking (ET), etc.

It also has a Thymeleaf providing a single page with JS, so we can play a bit with Feature Flags too.

I might re-write this or another app in dropwizard, but right now Spring Boot is the way!
